Solar Panel Tracking System


_Overview_
-  This project focuses on the design and implementation of a solar panel tracking system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system uses Light Dependent       Resistors (LDRs) to detect sunlight intensity and a servo motor to adjust the position of the solar panel for optimal energy capture. This project aims to improve the efficiency of solar panels by ensuring they are always oriented towards the brightest light source.


_Project Description_
-  The solar panel tracking system automatically adjusts the panel's position to track the sun's movement, maximizing energy efficiency. The system leverages sensors to detect light intensity and a servo motor to move the solar panel accordingly. The entire setup is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.


_Features_
-  Dual LDR-based light detection for tracking sunlight.
Arduino Uno controls the movement of the solar panel.
Servo motor for smooth and precise panel positioning.
Adjustable tolerance to prevent constant motor movement.
Efficient design for improving solar energy harvesting.


_Hardware Requirements_
-  To replicate this project, you will need the following components:
**Arduino Uno
Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) x 2
Servo Motor
Resistors (various values)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Solar Panel (optional for demonstration purposes)**


_Software Requirements_
**Arduino IDE
Servo library (pre-installed with Arduino IDE)
Embedded C (for writing the code)**


_Usage_
Setup the hardware: Connect the components (LDRs, servo motor, resistors) to the Arduino following the wiring diagram provided in the project documentation.
Power the system: Once connected, the Arduino will automatically adjust the servo motor to move the solar panel according to the light intensity detected by the LDRs.
Observe the panel's movement: The solar panel should move towards the direction of the highest light intensity.


_Challenges_
Time constraints limited the extent of testing and optimization.
Sourcing hardware components that were cost-effective and met project needs.
Assembling the components and ensuring stable operation of the system.
Writing efficient code to prevent unnecessary motor movement.


_Future Work_
Implement dual-axis tracking for more precise positioning.
Explore more efficient and sensitive sensors to increase performance.
Add features like weather detection (rain, cloudy) to stop movement in unfavorable conditions.
Consider a low-power design for off-grid applications.
